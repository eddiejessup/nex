\catcode`\{=1 % left brace is begin-group character
\catcode`\}=2 % right brace is end-group character
\catcode`\$=3 % dollar sign is math shift
\catcode`\&=4 % ampersand is alignment tab
\catcode`\#=6 % hash mark is macro parameter character
\catcode`\^=7 \catcode`\^^K=7 % circumflex and uparrow are for superscripts
\catcode`\_=8 \catcode`\^^A=8 % underline and downarrow are for subscripts
\catcode`\^^I=10 % ascii tab is a blank space
\chardef\active=13 \catcode`\~=\active % tilde is active
\catcode`\^^L=\active \outer\def^^L{\par} % ascii form-feed is "\outer\par"

\message{Preloading the plain format: codes,}

% We had to define the \catcodes right away, before the message line,
% since \message uses the { and } characters.
% When INITEX (the TeX initializer) starts up,
% it has defined the following \catcode values:
% \catcode`\^^@=9 % ascii null is ignored
% \catcode`\^^M=5 % ascii return is end-line
% \catcode`\\=0 % backslash is TeX escape character
% \catcode`\%=14 % percent sign is comment character
% \catcode`\ =10 % ascii space is blank space
% \catcode`\^^?=15 % ascii delete is invalid
% \catcode`\A=11 ... \catcode`\Z=11 % uppercase letters
% \catcode`\a=11 ... \catcode`\z=11 % lowercase letters
% all others are type 12 (other)

% Here is a list of the characters that have been specially catcoded:
\def\dospecials{\do\ \do\\\do\{\do\}\do\$\do\&%
  \do\#\do\^\do\^^K\do\_\do\^^A\do\%\do\~}
% (not counting ascii null, tab, linefeed, formfeed, return, delete)
% Each symbol in the list is preceded by \do, which can be defined
% if you want to do something to every item in the list.

% We make @ signs act like letters, temporarily, to avoid conflict
% between user names and internal control sequences of plain format.
\catcode`@=11

% INITEX sets up \mathcode x=x, for x=0..255, except that
% \mathcode x=x+"7100, for x = `A to `Z and `a to `z;
% \mathcode x=x+"7000, for x = `0 to `9.
% The following changes define internal codes as recommended
% in Appendix C of The TeXbook:
